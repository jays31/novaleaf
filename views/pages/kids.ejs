                        Novaleaf is an Education Institute founded in 2014, located in Halifax, Canada and Beijing, China. Novaleaf is committed to providing the students with the assistance to their on-going academic curriculum at different levels/grades of school education. With small groups of students and our expert faculty members from industry and academia, we not only focus on enhancing the academic performance of a child but also try to bridge the gap between the school curriculum and the industry requirements. We provide flexible and customized support to the students keeping in mind their needs and requirements. Apart from academic support for various courses (Science and Mathematics) we also provide courses pertaining to STEAM through Robotics & LEGO. We also cover the spheres of providing English language training, IELTS training, business English training, University courses tutoring, education consultation and career training. We completely understand and appreciate the fact that no two people have same or even similar hurdles in life in terms of building a career, fetching the right job or even otherwise. Sticking to this notion, we strongly believe that customizing the curriculum is the key criteria to provide the best possible solution. Adhering to our unique understanding of the needs and requirements, we carefully craft our curriculum to get the best results.
